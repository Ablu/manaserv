## Comment
New proposal after considering lag and the ability to run, jump, fly or whatever (sent as flag). The MOVE_IN_DIRECTION_FROM message would be sent on certain intervals while a being moves, to ensure the position stays in sync.
 0x0000 - MOVE_IN_DIRECTION        { B direction (n, ne, e, se, s, sw, w, nw, stop), B flags }
 0x0001 - MOVE_IN_DIRECTION_FROM   { S x, S y, B direction (n, ne, e, se, s, sw, w, nw, stop), B flags }
 0x0002 - MOVE_TO_TARGET           { S x, S y, B flags }
