As per Elven's request, I'm making this document to contain the information
relevant to server development as far as my understanding goes. This file
contains the following:
 - Information that will be stored in Player Account



1. Information stored in a Player Account
  - Inventory - an array of 110 item IDs (the last 10 slots or so are current
                equipment)
  - Position - the place where the player is in worldspace (3 ints, x, y, map)
  - Estate - stored as an array of Tiled maps, the same way any map is.
  - Skills - an array of 100 Skill structures
  - Quest Info - an array of X short integers, specifying the player's position
                 in or accomplishment of the game quests. (X is the number of
                 quests)
  - Pet Status - pets are stored as an array of skills and some general
                 information (age, type of monster, loyalty, equipment, etc.)
                 You can have up to 3 pets at once.
