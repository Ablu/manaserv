Generic scripting interfaces for various in-game objects.

Functions Library - provided by server scripting bindings.
Public Interface  - public interface provided by script.
Public Variables   - public variables provided by script.
Persistent Variabls - Variables which persist.

All prototypes are in a C like syntax.

Global Function Library (accessible by all script types):
  string getName(void)	- Get name of player.
  uint getX(void)	- Get X position of player.
  uint getY(void)	- Get Y position of player.
  string getMap(void)	- Get map name.
  uint getLevel(void)	- Get player level.
  uint getHealth(void)	- Get current health of player using item.
  uint getMaxHealth(void)	- Get maximum health player can have.
  uint getAttack(void)	- Get attack stats of player.
