	* src/accounthandler.cpp, src/client.cpp, src/dalstorage.cpp,
	src/main.cpp, src/mapmanager.cpp, src/mapmanager.h, src/netcomputer.cpp,
	src/object.cpp, src/object.h, src/state.cpp, tmwserv.dev: Fixed default map
	definition for a new created character, enabled loading of map when a
	character is on it, fixed inconsistency in getter/setter for map id.

2006-01-09  Eugenio Favalli  <elvenprogrammer@gmail.com>

	* src/dalstorage.cpp: Fixed some sql query issues.

2005-01-08  Yohann Ferreira  <bertram@cegetel.net>

	* src/defines.h, src/client.cpp, src/accounthandler.cpp,
	src/dalstorage.cpp, src/storage.h, src/dalstorage.h,

	src/object.cpp, src/being.cpp, src/state.h, src/state.cpp,
	src/mapmanager.h, src/main.cpp, src/mapmanager.cpp: Added
	customization of created character. (That makes previously created db
	invalid.) Made list of map indexed by map id, instead of map name.
	This will prevent unsyncing of player's current map when changing a
	map name. Remember you have now to add a map filename into db before
	being able to load it. (Default map id is 1, not ZERO, as zero is the
	not found return value.

2005-01-04  Yohann Ferreira  <bertram@cegetel.net>

	* src/defines.h, src/accounthandler.cpp, src/main.cpp, src/client.cpp:

	that made the Email change not possible. Changed some protocol value to
	have a litte neater client code. Added FreeBSD fix idea from icy to
	server code.

2005-12-28  Bjørn Lindeijer  <bjorn@lindeijer.nl>

	* makeclient.sh, src/Makefile.am: Integrated the building of tmwclient
	with the default make command, as contributed by r0nny.
	* src/main.cpp: Applied patch by r0nny that makes main.cpp a bit

2005-12-26  Bjørn Lindeijer  <bjorn@lindeijer.nl>

	* src/storage.cpp: Removed manual throwing of std::bad_alloc, which

	r0nny.

	src/dalstorage.h, src/storage.h, src/client.cpp, src/main.cpp:
	Now beings are handled in netcomputer when added and removed

	that. Added CMSG_CHAR_LIST packet support.

2005-12-11  Yohann Ferreira  <bertram@cegetel.net>

	length support. Also made some little tweaks.

2005-12-10  Yohann Ferreira  <bertram@cegetel.net>

	* src/dalstorage.cpp: Fixed the buggy part of getAccount()
	where the mapInfo() recordSet erased the value of charInfo.
	Now, characters can be created and selected, with the map
	they were in, set.

2005-12-09  Yohann Ferreira  <bertram@cegetel.net>

	* src/dalstorage.cpp, src/accounthandler.cpp: Temporary
	made a workaround the character misloading at login.
	Work is to be made to see why the mapInfo recordset is
	buggy. Also made the server more verbose about characters.

2005-12-08  Yohann Ferreira  <bertram@cegetel.net>

	* src/dalstorage.cpp: Improved the getEmailList() function.
	Now the file used as db or the db name is shown in log.
	* src/defines.h: Added some missing messages and values for
	them. Login, pass min, max length can be changed there now.
	* src/accounthandler.cpp: Added check and appropriate response
	when selecting, creating a character.

2005-12-05  Yohann Ferreira  <bertram@cegetel.net>

	* src/dalstorage.cpp: Added a working getEmailList() function.
	* src/accounthandler: Now tests if email already exists.
	* src/accounthandler.cpp, src/defines.h: Strengthens the way
	email addresses checked. Added good response for selecting
	a char when not logged.
	* src/storage.h, src/dalstorage.h, src/dalstorage.cpp: Added
	the getEmailList function, doesn't seem to work, but committed
	to see why.

2005-12-03  Yohann Ferreira  <bertram@cegetel.net>

	* src/accounthandler.cpp: Handling good conditions to register.
	Still lacks checking if the Email already exists.
	* src/dalstorage.cpp: Fixed a bug that throwed an exception when
	logging with an account that had no mapInfo yet.
	Still has to set these to defaults in such case.

2005-12-02  Yohann Ferreira  <bertram@cegetel.net>

	* src/main.cpp, src/accounthandler.h, src/accounthandler.cpp,
	src/configuration.h: Made the accounthandler reopen the db for
	SQLite to enable registering ! Now working.
