Setting up a TMW server
=======================

The compilation should produce two binaries: tmwserv-account and
tmwserv-game.

Run tmwserv-account on one single computer. It will open three
consecutive UDP ports, starting from the one given by the configuration
option "accountServerPort" (default value: 9601). This first port is the
one you should give to your users.

Run tmwserv-game on multiple computers. Each game server will open one
UDP port given by the configuration option "gameServerPort" (default
value: 9604). It will also connect to the account server given by the
configuration options "accountServerAddress" (default value: localhost)
and "accountServerPort". The configuration option "gameServerAddress"
should contain the public address of the computer the server runs on, as
it will be sent to the users. The file data/maps.xml contains the maps
the server will load and register on the account server; split it
across your multiple game servers, in order to balance the load.
