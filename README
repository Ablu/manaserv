Setting up a TMW server
=======================

The compilation should produce two binaries: tmwserv-account and
tmwserv-game.

1. Run tmwserv-account on one single computer. It will open three
consecutive UDP ports, starting from the one given by the configuration
option "accountServerPort". This first port is the one you should
advertise to your users. The configuration option "accountServerAddress"
should contain the public address the server runs on, as it will be sent
to the users as the address of the chat server, which happens to be the
account server for now.

2. Run tmwserv-game on multiple computers. Each game server will open
one UDP port given by the configuration option "gameServerPort". It will
also connect to the account server given by the configuration options
"accountServerAddress" and "accountServerPort". The configuration option
"gameServerAddress" should contain the public address of the computer
the server runs on, as it will be sent to the users. The file
data/maps.xml contains the maps the server will load and register on the
account server; split it across your multiple game servers, in order to
balance the load.

Access to port "accountServerPort + 1" of the account server can be
restricted to connections from game servers only. Users do not need to
access it.

Default option values:

	accountServerAddress		localhost
	accountServerPort		9601
	gameServerAddress		localhost
	gameServerPort			9604
